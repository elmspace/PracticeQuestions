"""
	Given a singly linked list, devise a time- and space-efficient algorithm to find the mth-to-last element of the list.
	Implement your algorithm, taking care to handle relevant error conditions.
	Define mth to last such that when m = 0 the last element of the list is returned.
	Note here that we are measuring the distance to the last element. In a singly link list, we can only traverse in 1 direction. 

	Notes:
	Here are few ways we can look at this problem, remembering we need to save time and space.
